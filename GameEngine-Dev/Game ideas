Game ideas

Open world adventure optional clicker for resource gain (over use results in you becoming evil lord of universe / world)
in-built collectable card game with hologram monster fights

Characters:
playable - npc - all characters are playable? 
From ~ 1/2 way through you are able to employ other characters to do things for you, although you are always juggling favours from the beginning

Opening - Player wakes up in a daze? Cutscene story opening where player prays for assistance in a lightning storm, lightning strikes a totem in the village and spawns the player's mouse - player starts by clicking things and then you learn how to possess the player / things in the world (maybe you need permission from the character to take them over)
